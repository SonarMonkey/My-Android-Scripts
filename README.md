# My-Android-Scripts

This is a set of basic bash scripts for Linux/Mac/Android to ease various processes.
So far, there is only one script I'm working on, as detailed below. There will eventually be more!

Auto-Flash is a script to back up, wipe, and install a new setup on an Android device via TWRP's adb shell.
Keep in mind this is still in alpha, and may not work as intended. WILL WIPE YOUR DEVICE!

AUTO_FLASH IS NOT CURRENTLY FUNCTIONING, DO NOT USE!!!
