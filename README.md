# My-Android-Scripts

This is a set of basic bash scripts for Linux/Mac/Android to ease various processes.
So far, there is only one script I'm working on, as detailed below. There will eventually be more!

Auto-Flash is a script to back up, wipe, and install a new setup on an Android device via local adb and TWRP's adb shell interface commands.
Keep in mind this script still in alpha, and may not work as intended.
THIS SCRIPT WILL WIPE YOUR DEVICE!
AUTO_FLASH IS NOT CURRENTLY FUNCTIONING, DO NOT USE!!!
